          Maybe one of the greatest experiences that I had in my life was to make someone to understand somthing. And it gets better when that thing is somthing like programming or math.

            I teached (mostly private) to teenagers and adults have to solve problems. Sometime using numbers and pen, sometime using code and keyboard.
            #Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          I also was in national Olympiad in Informatics but because of some family problems(such as my dad's cancer) I could not study and code properly for a long time since highschool. Until I come into college and come back into the road.
